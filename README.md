The sample program I've created is meant to demonstrate the overall function and usefulness of Fastify. It is a basic launcher which initializes a local server which creates a... surprise when opened. After you've installed Fastify, navigate to **"localhost/3000**" in a compatible web browser to watch the function execute.

Enjoy!
